Image Configuration Guide:
================================================================================

【Basic Configuration】
Add images array to timeline items, supports 1-2 images:

  images = ["/images/xxx.jpg"]           # Single image
  images = ["/images/a.jpg", "/images/b.jpg"]  # Dual images

【Image Fit Mode - image_fit parameter】

1. contain (recommended for Logos/Icons)
   - Displays full image without cropping
   - Image is centered with margins
   - Subtle zoom and shadow on hover
   - Best for: Logos, Icons, Illustrations
   
   Example:
   images = ["https://example.com/logo.png"]
   image_fit = "contain"

2. cover (default, recommended for Photos/Backgrounds)
   - Fills entire card, may crop edges
   - Zoom + parallax effect on hover
   - Best for: Landscapes, Event photos, Backgrounds
   
   Example:
   images = ["/images/photo.jpg"]
   # image_fit defaults to "cover" if not specified

【Image Source Types】

1. Local Images (Recommended)
   Place images in static/images/ directory:
   images = ["/images/photo.jpg"]

2. External URL (HTTPS supported)
   images = ["https://example.com/logo.png"]
   
   ⚠️ Notes:
   - Ensure the image allows cross-origin access (CORS)
   - Use HTTPS to avoid mixed content warnings
   - External links may break, keep local backups for important images

【Dual Image Combinations】
- contain + contain: Side-by-side logos
- cover + cover: Diagonal split backgrounds
- contain + cover: Left icon + Right background (rich visual effect)

【Recommended Specifications】
- Logo/Icon: 400x400px+, PNG with transparent background preferred
- Photos: 800x400px+, 2:1 or 16:9 ratio
- File size: < 200KB per image
- Style: Dark / low saturation for better text contrast
